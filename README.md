# MicroSoundInstrument
A patch designed for sample manipulation with the use of the keyboard and mouse to trigger and manipulate samples.

This patch is a multi purpose audio manipulation tool. It can be used as an effects processor or an instrument for live performance. You can use any samples you like provided you assign the correct file directories. The concept is simple. Each key triggers a different granular, spectral or randomised effect process. Some keys activate the use of the mouse, others trigger randomised chopping effects and there’s also a whole section for spectral processing. Additionally i’ve designed a ‘randomise all’ function, which harnesses the full capability of the patch and automates it without you having to touch a thing.

It’s designed to be relatively self contained in that only one line of code need be evaluated in ‘OpenThisFile.scd’ to open the GUI. So download the whole folder and follow the instructions if you’d like to have a try.
